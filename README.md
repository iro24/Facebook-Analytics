If you ever thought that Facebook and Messenger are storing many things and with this small project, you will get an insight on how dependent are you on this social network.

Once you have the archive, open it and go to html folder and copy "messages.htm" in your directory.

You can do the following with this notebook:
  1) check how many messages you or others sent to you
  2) how many conversations you had
  3) how many number of calls you had with your friends or the one you missed (English, Italian or Russian)
  4) check the most used words
  5) Plot the number of calls versus the number of total messages
  6) Plot the timeline of these calls and messages
  7) Export them in a csv file sorted by date
